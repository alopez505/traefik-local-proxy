# Optional hardening

## Dashboard basic auth

Add a `dynamic/dashboard-auth.yml` file (gitignore it if it contains
credentials):

```yaml
http:
  middlewares:
    dashboard-auth:
      basicAuth:
        users:
          - "admin:$apr1$..."  # htpasswd -nb admin <password>
```

Then reference the middleware on the dashboard router label in
`docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
traefik.http.routers.proxy.middlewares: "dashboard-auth@file"
```

Since ports are loopback-only, this is defense-in-depth, not a hard
requirement.

## Security response headers

Add `dynamic/security-headers.yml` and reference it as a middleware on any
router:

```yaml
http:
  middlewares:
    security-headers:
      headers:
        frameDeny: true
        contentTypeNosniff: true
        browserXssFilter: true
        referrerPolicy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        # HSTS intentionally disabled - do not enable on a dev domain.
        # Preloaded HSTS persists in browsers after you decommission the proxy.
        # forceSTSHeader: true
        # stsSeconds: 31536000
```
